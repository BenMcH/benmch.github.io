You can't have a blog from a programmer without the first post being Hello World! This isn't any different.

### Who are you?

I am an IT professional with several different roles in my current position. I do much of the programming on the company's intranet web app. I do much of the database administration, and I manage the help desk!

### What is this blog?

This blog is going to be used for a multitude of things ranging from personal projects with react-native to issues in my company's Ruby on Rails app to other everyday hobbies and schooling.
